## How to Take Screenshots

### For Web Pages:
1. Use browser dev tools (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "Capture screenshot")
2. Or use macOS Screenshot tool (Cmd + Shift + 4)
3. Crop/resize to consistent dimensions

### Tips:
- Use consistent browser window size (1280x720 recommended)
- Clear any sensitive data (real emails, phone numbers)
- Use light mode for better visibility
- Consider adding annotations with arrows/highlights

### Tools:
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) — macOS screenshot tool
- [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) — Cross-platform
- [Figma](https://figma.com) — For mockups/annotations

## Alternative: Use Placeholders

If screenshots aren't ready yet, use placeholder images from:
- [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

Example:
```markdown
![Homepage](https://via.placeholder.com/1920x1080/FF6B35/FFFFFF?text=Homepage+Screenshot)
```
